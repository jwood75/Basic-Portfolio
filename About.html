	Hello! I'm Joshua Wood (but most people just call me Josh) welcome to my portfolio! I graduated from UNC Charlotte with my Bachelors of Fine Arts concentrating in Illustration. My interest in illustration started an early age while reading children's books and exploring the works of Eric Carle, Beatrix Potter, A. A. Milne, and Dr. Seuss. I now wish to break into the children's book market with my own work. Here on my website you can find my most recent and updated work as well as the best methods of contacting me. Feel free to ask any questions and I hope you enjoy your stay!
